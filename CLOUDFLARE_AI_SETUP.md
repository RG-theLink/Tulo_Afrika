# 🔧 Cloudflare Workers AI Setup Guide

## ⚠️ ISSUE IDENTIFIED

From your screenshots, I can see that **Cloudflare Workers AI is not yet enabled** in your account. This is why you're still getting errors.

## ✅ HOW TO ENABLE CLOUDFLARE WORKERS AI

### Step 1: Enable Workers AI in Cloudflare Dashboard

1. Go to your Cloudflare Dashboard: https://dash.cloudflare.com
2. Click on **"AI"** in the left sidebar (the option you showed in your screenshot)
3. Click **"Workers AI"** 
4. Click **"Get Started"** or **"Enable Workers AI"**
5. Accept the terms (it's FREE with generous limits)

### Step 2: Verify in Pages Project

1. Go to **Pages** → **tulo-afrika** → **Settings**
2. Scroll to **"Functions"** → **"AI Bindings"**
3. You should see AI binding is now available

### Step 3: Redeploy Your Application

Option A: Trigger new deployment
```bash
cd /home/user/webapp
git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger rebuild with AI enabled"
git push origin main
```

Option B: Manual redeploy
1. Go to Cloudflare Pages → tulo-afrika
2. Click on latest deployment
3. Click "Retry deployment"

## 🎯 CURRENT STATUS (From Your Screenshots)

### What's Working:
- ✅ Database connected
- ✅ KV Storage working
- ✅ OpenRouter configured as fallback
- ✅ Diagnostic tools functioning

### What Needs Fixing:
- ❌ Cloudflare AI not enabled (shows "not available")
- This is causing the AI features to fail because OpenRouter alone isn't handling the requests properly

## 🚀 IMMEDIATE WORKAROUND

While you enable Cloudflare AI, I'm updating the code to better handle OpenRouter as the sole provider:

### Updated Environment Variables Needed:

In Cloudflare Dashboard → Pages → tulo-afrika → Settings → Environment Variables:

```
OPENROUTER_API_KEY = [your_actual_api_key]
OPENROUTER_API_URL = https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
```

**IMPORTANT**: Make sure you have added your actual OpenRouter API key, not "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"

## 📝 To Get Your OpenRouter API Key:

1. Go to: https://openrouter.ai
2. Sign up/Login
3. Go to Settings → API Keys
4. Create a new API key
5. Add it to Cloudflare environment variables

## 🔍 Why This Is Happening

The errors in your console show:
- `Failed to load resource: the server responded with /api/ai/copilot:1`
- Invalid token errors

This is because:
1. Cloudflare AI is not enabled (primary provider failing)
2. OpenRouter fallback is not properly configured with a valid API key

## ✨ Once Cloudflare AI is Enabled

After enabling Cloudflare Workers AI:
- No API key needed
- Free tier with 10,000 requests/day
- Faster response times
- Automatic availability

## 📊 Testing After Fix

Once you've enabled Cloudflare AI or added OpenRouter API key:

1. Visit: https://tulo-afrika.pages.dev/api/diagnostic/test-ai
2. You should see successful responses from at least one provider
3. Test the AI features again - they'll work!

## 🆘 If You Still Have Issues

1. **Check API Key**: Ensure OpenRouter API key is correctly added (no quotes, no spaces)
2. **Clear Cache**: Hard refresh with Ctrl+Shift+R
3. **Check Logs**: Cloudflare Dashboard → Pages → Functions → Real-time logs

## 💡 The Bottom Line

Your issue is that neither AI provider is currently working:
- **Cloudflare AI**: Not enabled in your account (needs to be activated)
- **OpenRouter**: No valid API key configured

Fix either one (or both) and your AI features will work immediately!
