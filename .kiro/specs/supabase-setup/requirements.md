# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves setting up a new Supabase connection for the existing React/TypeScript application. The application already has Supabase client code and migration files, but lacks the necessary configuration and connection to an active Supabase project. This setup will enable database functionality, authentication, and real-time features for the application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to establish a connection to a new Supabase project, so that the application can access database and authentication services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL successfully connect to a Supabase project without throwing connection errors
2. WHEN environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating which variables are required
3. IF the Supabase connection is established THEN the system SHALL be able to perform authentication operations
4. WHEN the connection is active THEN the system SHALL be able to execute database queries through the Supabase client

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to apply existing database migrations to the new Supabase project, so that the database schema matches the application's requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrations are applied THEN the system SHALL create all necessary database tables and structures
2. IF migration files exist THEN the system SHALL apply them in the correct chronological order
3. WHEN migrations complete successfully THEN the system SHALL reflect the current schema state
4. IF a migration fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information and rollback capabilities

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure environment variables securely, so that sensitive credentials are not exposed in the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN environment variables are configured THEN the system SHALL load Supabase URL and anonymous key from environment files
2. IF environment files are missing THEN the system SHALL provide setup instructions
3. WHEN credentials are stored THEN the system SHALL exclude them from version control
4. IF invalid credentials are provided THEN the system SHALL display meaningful error messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify the database connection and functionality, so that I can confirm the setup is working correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the setup is complete THEN the system SHALL successfully authenticate test users
2. IF database operations are performed THEN the system SHALL execute CRUD operations without errors
3. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL display connection status information
4. IF real-time features are enabled THEN the system SHALL establish WebSocket connections for live updates
